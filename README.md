OTA-Plist-Generator 

 

This tool generates .plist files for installing .ipa files on iOS without a computer. 

 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

Example: 

If you ever want to make a website that can install .ipa files on iOS without a computer, you can use this tool to do that. 

To make a website that supports OTA (Over-The-Air) installation of .ipa files, you will need to generate manifest.plist files for each app. This tool automates that for you. 

📲 How OTA Installation Works 

iOS allows OTA app installation using a special itms-services:// link. It looks like this: 

itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://yourdomain.com/path/manifest.plist 
 

This tells the iOS device to read the manifest .plist file, which then tells it: 

What app to install (via the .ipa URL) 

What name/version to show 

What bundle ID to expect 

🛠 What You Need 

A hosted website or server with HTTPS (you can use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any VPS) 

The .ipa files uploaded to it 

The .plist files generated by this tool, also uploaded to the server 

A web page or shortcut that links to: 

itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://yourdomain.com/yourmanifest.plist 
 

You can make a clean install page with buttons like: 

<a href="itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://yourdomain.com/unc0ver.plist"> 
  <button>Install unc0ver</button> 
</a> 
 

💡 You can even make multiple install buttons on one page — each pointing to a different .plist file. 

 

🪟 Windows Tutorial 

Download the latest .exe release from the Releases section. 

Once downloaded, double-click the .exe file to run it. No installation required. 

The GUI window will open. 

Select up to 10 .ipa files using the buttons labeled “Select IPA 1”, “Select IPA 2”, etc. 

In the IPA File Link URL field, enter the base URL where your .ipa files will be hosted. 

Example: 

https://yourdomain.com 
  

Click the "Generate Plists" button. You’ll be asked to choose a folder where the .plist files will be saved. 

The app will create one .plist file for each .ipa, using the metadata inside the app if possible. 

Upload the generated .plist files and .ipa files to your server, then use itms-services:// links to trigger installs on iOS. 

 

🛠 Troubleshooting 

If the tool doesn't extract info from the .ipa file, it may be using a binary-encoded Info.plist. This is a known issue and a fix is currently being worked on. 

Some antivirus programs may warn about .exe files — if you're using the file from the official release page, it's safe. 

 
🍎🐧 macOS / Linux Tutorial 

This tool is written in Python, so you can run it easily on macOS or Linux by following the steps below. 

 

✅ Requirements 

Python 3.7 or higher 

tkinter installed (usually comes with Python) 

A GUI environment (this is a graphical tool) 

 

🛠️ How to Run 

Download or clone the repository: 

git clone https://github.com/kolia44914/ota-plist-generator.git 
cd ota-plist-generator 
  

(Or just download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.) 

Install Python if needed 

macOS usually comes with Python 3. If not, install it via: 

brew install python 
  

On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): 

sudo apt update 
sudo apt install python3 python3-tk 
  

Run the tool: 

python3 ipasign-devtool.py 
  

This will open the graphical interface. 

 

🧪 Usage (same on all platforms) 

Click “Select IPA” to choose one or more .ipa files. 

Enter the base URL where the .ipa files will be hosted (e.g., https://mydomain.com). 

Click “Generate Plists” and choose the folder to save your .plist files. 

Upload both the .ipa and .plist files to your server. 

You can then use itms-services:// links on iOS to install the apps wirelessly. 

 

⚠️ Note on Binary Info.plist 

Some .ipa files (like unc0ver) use a binary format for their Info.plist, which this tool cannot fully parse yet. If metadata like the app name or bundle ID is missing, this is likely the reason. A fix is in progress.
